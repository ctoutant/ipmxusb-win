# USB/IP for Windows

- This project aims to support both a USB/IP server and a client on Windows platform.


## Build

### Notes
- Build is tested on Windows 10 x64 and the projects are configured for this target by default.
- x86/x64 platforms should be supported. However, we don't have an x86 setup for testing at the moment.
- For Windows 7 users, change `usbip_stub` and `usbip_vhci` projects' Target OS version to `Windows 7`.
  - Right-click on the `Project > Properties > Driver Settings > Target OS version > Windows 7`
  - The recent tag version which supports is v0.1.0. All versions after v0.1.0 do not support Windows 7 or 8 because usbip-win started to use kernel libraries of Windows 10.

### Build Tools
- Visual Studio 2019 Community (v142)
  - Build with VS 2017 (v141) is also possible if Platform Toolset in Setting is configured to v141.
- Windows SDK 10.0.18362.0 (recommended)
  - VS 2019 (v142): requires &gt;= 10.0.18xxx
  - VS 2017 (v141): requires &gt;= 10.0.17xxx
- Windows Driver Kit Windows 10, version 1903 (10.0.18362)
  - WDK 10.0.17134 (1803), 10.0.17763 (1809) and 10.0.18346 are also tested.

### Build Process
- Open `usbip_win.sln`
- If VS 2017 is used, SDK version for userspace projects (`usbip`, `usbip_common`, `usbipd`, `stubctl`) should be adjusted.
- Set certificate driver signing for `usbip_stub` and `usbip_vhci` projects
  - Right-click on the `Project > Properties > Driver Signing > Test Certificate`
  - Browse to `driver/usbip_test.pfx` (password: usbip)
- Build solution or desired project
- All output files are created under {Debug,Release}/{x64,x86} folder.

## Install

### Windows USB/IP server
- Prepare a Linux machine as a USB/IP client or Windows usbip-win VHCI client (tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with kernel 4.15.0-29 - USB/IP kernel module crash was observed on some other versions)
  - `# modprobe vhci-hcd`
- Install USB/IP test certificate
  - Install `driver/usbip_test.pfx` (password: usbip)
  - Certificate should be installed into
    1. "Trusted Root Certification Authority" in "Local Computer" (not current user) *and*
    2. "Trusted Publishers" in "Local Computer" (not current user)
- If *necessary*, disable Memory Integrity (Windows 11) - ***See `Common Issues` below***
  - From the start menu search for `Core Isolation`
  - Disable Memory Integrity
  - Either reboot or wait until enabling test signing
- Enable test signing
  - `> bcdedit.exe /set TESTSIGNING ON`
  - reboot the system to apply
- Copy `usbip.exe`, `usbipd.exe`, `usb.ids`, `usbip_stub.sys`, `usbip_stub.inx` into a folder in target machine
  - You can find `usbip.exe`, `usbipd.exe`, `usbip_stub.sys` in the output folder after build or on [release](https://github.com/cezanne/usbip-win/releases) page.
  - `userspace/usb.ids`
  - `driver/stub/usbip_stub.inx`
- Find USB Device ID
  - You can get id from usbip listing
    - `> usbip.exe list -l`
  - Bus id is always 1. So output from `usbip.exe` listing is shown as:
```
usbip.exe list -l
 - busid 1-59 (045e:00cb)
   Microsoft Corp. : Basic Optical Mouse v2.0 (045e:00cb)
 - busid 1-30 (80ee:0021)
   VirtualBox : USB Tablet (80ee:0021)
```
- Bind USB device to usbip stub
  - The next command replaces the existing function driver with usbip stub driver
    - This should be executed using administrator privilege
    - `usbip_stub.inx` and `usbip_stub.sys` files should be in the same folder as `usbip.exe`
  - `> usbip.exe bind -b 1-59`
- Run `usbipd.exe`
  - `> usbipd.exe -d -4`
  - TCP port `3240` should be allowed by firewall
- Attach USB/IP device on Linux machine
  - `# usbip attach -r <usbip server ip> -b 1-59`

### Windows USB/IP client
- Currently, there are 2 versions for a VHCI driver with different installation procedures:
  - `vhci(wdm)`: original version, implemented via WDM (Windows Driver Model);
  - `vhci(ude)`: newly developed version to fully support USB applications and implemented via UDE (USB Device Emulation) which is MS provided USB virtualization framework over KMDF (Kernel-Model Driver Framework).
- Prepare a Linux machine as a USB/IP server or Windows usbip-win stub server - (tested on Ubuntu 16.04 (kernel 4.15.0-29), 18.04, 20.04)
  - `# modprobe usbip-host`
  - You can use virtual [usbip-vstub](https://github.com/cezanne/usbip-vstub) as a stub server
- Run usbipd on a USB/IP server (Linux)
  - `# usbipd -4 -d`
- Install USB/IP test certificate
  - Install `driver/usbip_test.pfx` (password: usbip)
  - Certificate should be installed into
    1. "Trusted Root Certification Authority" in "Local Computer" (not current user) *and*
    2. "Trusted Publishers" in "Local Computer" (not current user)
- If *necessary*, disable Memory Integrity (Windows 11) - ***See `Common Issues` below***
  - From the start menu search for `Core Isolation`
  - Disable Memory Integrity
  - Either reboot or wait until enabling test signing
- Enable test signing
  - `> bcdedit.exe /set TESTSIGNING ON`

### Reporting Bugs
- `usbip-win` is not yet ready for production use. We could find the problems with detailed logs.

#### How to get Windows kernel log for vhci(wdm)
- Set registry key to enable a debug filter
  - `usbip-win` uses [DbgPrintEx API for kernel logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/reading-and-filtering-debugging-messages).
  - save following as `.reg` file and run or manually insert the registry key
  - reboot the system to apply
```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Debug Print Filter]
"IHVDRIVER"=dword:ffffffff
```
- Run a debugging log viewer program before you test.
  - [DebugView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) is a good tool to view the logs.
- If your testing machine suffer from BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), you should get it via remote debugging.
  - `WinDbg` on virtual machines would be good to get logs.

#### How to get Windows kernel log for vhci(ude)
- A new vhci(ude) implementation uses WPP SW tracing instead of DbgPrintEx.
  - `DebugView.exe` cannot catch a VHCI debug message
    - `TraceView.exe` is a good utility for a new approach, which is included in WDK.
- `usbip_vhci_ude.pdb` file is required to add a trace provider easily.
- Create a new session log in `TraceView.exe`
  - Choose PDB file radio button in \"*Provider Control GUID Setup*\" popup dialog
  - Specify `usbip_vhci_ude.pdb` as a PDB file
- You can send real-time trace messages to WinDbg by modifying in \"*Advanced Log Session Options*\".
- If your testing machine suffer from BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), you should get it via remote debugging.
  - `WinDbg` on virtual machines would be good to get logs

#### How to get usbip forwarder log
- usbip-win transmits usbip packets via a userland forwarder.
  - forwarder log is the best to look into usbip packet internals. 
- edit `usbip_forward.c` to define `DEBUG_PDU` at the head of the file
- compile `usbip.exe` or `usbipd.exe`
- `debug_pdu.log` is created at the path where an executable runs.  

#### How to get linux kernel log
- Sometimes Linux kernel log is required
```
# dmesg --follow | tee kernel_log.txt
```

#### Certificate alternatives

If you are having difficulties getting your certificate to be found by the signing tool it is possible to reference the certificate by it's common name or it's thumbprint, rather than using a local file in the build environment.  Once you have installed the certificate in the instructions outlined earlier, under the project properties for the project in question go to the `Driver Signing` page.  Then, under the certificate's path simply set the path to one of the following:

    Option 1: CN="USBIP Test" | C5F7A75CB6019FCAE821E03D9272F9AF89E7AA5D
		- This is the best practice
  
    Option 2: CN="USBIP Test"
		- This could find multiple certificates in the store if they share the same common name

    Option 3: C5F7A75CB6019FCAE821E03D9272F9AF89E7AA5D
		- This is adequate, but makes it difficult for anyone to find the certificate at a later date if needed since they would have to lookup the common name

	NOTE: The provided example values are the CN and thumbprint are from the included `usbip_test.pfx` file

- *Side note: This also eliminates any need to include the certificate in a project's repository or relative file system, which inherently is a fair bit safer in more sensitive projects.*

#### Common Issues

With Windows 11 and the much stricter security requirements you may run into several issues that are not straightforward to diagnose - chief of which is anything related to allowing unsigned or self-signed code to run at all in kernel space.  Fortunately, Microsoft has made things easier where needed - but if you are still new to the world of driver development it is extremely difficult to understand why things are not working correctly.

-  *VHCI driver not loaded error*
   -  This is either due to not enabling `Test Signing` or, secondarily, due to not disabling `Memory Integrity`.
-  *Test Signing*
   -  With Windows 11 `Test Signing` cannot be turned on *after boot* when `SecureBoot` is enabled, which is basically a requirement on modern machines.  To enable test signing in this scenario navigate to `System -> Recovery` and select `Restart Now` under `Advanced Startup`.  This will bring you to the pre-boot menu for windows that will allow you to choose to enable `Test Signing`.  
      -  **NOTE:** If your drive has `Bitlocker` enabled you *will* be prompted for your bitlocker recovery code before allowed into the advanced startup options pre-boot menu.  To avoid multiple repeated reboots while you quietly mutter your grievances under your breath, I recommend having your recovery code ready.
-  *Memory Integrity*
   -  In short, Windows makes decisions on whether to allow your driver code to execute based upon several different factors.  One of these is `Memory Integrity`, which you can read into further detail about [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/core-isolation-e30ed737-17d8-42f3-a2a9-87521df09b78).  Anecdotally speaking, I have ran this project on Windows 11 without issue before disabling Memory Integrity; however, at some point my code would no longer execute for seemingly no reason.  I could not tell you why this change occurred, and I can assure that because reverting all my changes still caused issues.  Once I disabled Memory Integrity I was able to consistently and without fail execute my code on Windows 11.
      -  **NOTE:** *This is ONLY for testing.  Once in production you should have signed code that memory integrity will not stop from executing.*
